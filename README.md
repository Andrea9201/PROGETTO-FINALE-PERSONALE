# PROGETTO-FINALE-PERSONALE
The project consists of using a large dataset related to the world of chess. The idea is to exploit and use a simple Medallion architecture divided into 3 layers (Bronze, Silver, Gold). The database thus structured will need to be enriched, formatted and standardized in a simple way (Silver) to then be exploited by the final layer (Gold) to perform insights on the data previously established or in work in progress and possibly enrich with the insertion of additional data and maintaining the raw data (Bronze) in such a way as to have a backup and/or external use by other technical figures (Data Engineers). We will proceed to structure the same layers, to then carry out the Cleaning phase and/or other types of Data Transformation with Python/Pandas. Once the file has been saved, we will proceed with the creation of the schemas on MYSQL and subsequently proceed with the creation of any "Triggers" and "Stored Procedures" for automatic data maintenance and loading of the tables via LOAD DATA INFILE functions. In the final part, we will proceed with the visualization of the same via PowerBi with simple ad hoc reports that can capture the attention of the end user, taking care not to increase the difficulty level of the data itself, both in qualitative and quantitative terms.

NB 
1) THE FOLDER WITH ALL THE PROCESSED FILES, BEING TOO LARGE TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB, WILL BE UPLOADED TO THE PERSONAL GOOGLE DRIVE AND IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO ACCESS IT AT THE FOLLOWING LINK: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1FSSqYH8PeZsGBbFUN9x0gZsCIjJF39ew

2) THE GOLD DB BEING DERIVED FROM THE SILVER, HAS BEEN AVOIDED FROM BEING UPLOADED SO AS NOT TO WEIGHTEN THE FOLDER, BEING THE DBS PRACTICALLY IDENTICAL (THE GOLD DB IS THE SAME AS THE SILVER DB BECAUSE IT IS USED AS THE CENTRAL FACTS TABLE IN A STAR SCHEMA DIAGRAM)
